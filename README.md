# EventInviter

## Project Idea
Have you ever had the problem that you were creating multiple WhatsApp Groups or copying over the same message to each chat again and again while possibly forgetting to change the name of the recipient?

This is no more a problem with EventInviter.
EventInviter lets you create events, create your contacts and drag and drop Invitees to a specific Event.
Upon clicking  "send invites", WhatsApp will open in the browser and send the automatically rendered message.
